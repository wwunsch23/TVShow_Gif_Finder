## About the App

This app is designed to pull 10 random gifs from Giphy.com for a tv show of your choosing. There are select tv show buttons included on load, however, there is also a search box for the user to enter any tv show. After entering a tv show and clicking the Submit button, a button with the name of the tv show will appear alongside the other buttons at the top of the screen.

To see the gifs, the user has to click on a tv show button. The app will pull back 10 random gifs and display them. If the user likes any of the gifs, they can click the associated Save GIF button to add the gif to the Save section at the top of the page. Note, if the page is reloaded, the saved gifs will disappear. Under each saved GIF there is an associated Unsaved GIF button. If the user clicks that button, it will remove the saved GIF from the saved area.

When the gifs first load on the page they are still. To see the gif animation, the user has to click on the gif image. To stop the animation, click on the image again.

Next to the Submit button there is a Clear Results button. When the user clicks on this button it will remove the gifs that are displayed in the Search Results area, but it will not remove the saved gifs.
